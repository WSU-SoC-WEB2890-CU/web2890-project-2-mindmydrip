        <h2>About my Small Business and my family.</h2>
        <p class="aboutme-text">I'm Hollie Estes, and I'm a proud Utah native. Living in this beautiful state has filled me with inspiration from the stunning natural landscapes that surround us. I'm not just a small business owner; I'm a mother of two wonderful girls and a spirited boy, and they are the true source of my motivation.
            <br>
            Being a mother, my journey into the world of crafting and design started as a labor of love for my family. I wanted to bring joy and elegance into their lives, and that passion has grown into something more. It has grown into Hi-Hopes, a place where I share my creativity with others.
            <br>
            Drawing on the breathtaking landscapes of Utah, I create handcrafted garlands and decorative pieces that are deeply rooted in the rich and earthy tones of this state. Every piece I create is a reflection of my commitment to quality and attention to detail, and they carry with them the warmth of my family and our Utah home. When you bring home a Hi-Hopes garland, you're not just getting a beautifully handcrafted decor piece; you're welcoming a slice of Utah's beauty and my family's love into your own space.</p>
